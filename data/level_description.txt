You are an explorer trying to search for the hidden treasure of the great Pharaons. While digging for treasure in the desert, you find an antique site with a wooden door. Game Start. You can open the wooden door or continue digging. 
If you decide to open the wooden door, you will find the first room, Room-A, that has the wooden door, an orange door on the right, a hallway leading to Room-B, and a ladder going down. If you open the orange door, you will find Basement, which has a giant spider in the middle and a shining crown in the corner of the room. You can pick up the crown. If you go down the hallway, you will find Room-B. Room-B has the other end of the hallway, a throne in the middle of the room and a green door. You can sit on the throne. But only if you had the crown from Basement, the treasure chest will appear. If you open the green door, you will find Basement again.
If you decided to continue digging the sand, you will find some stairs leading to Room-C. Room-C has a ladder going up and black door. If you climb up the ladder, you will find Room-A. If you open the black door, you will find Room-D, which has the other side of the black door, a lava lake and a small, shining key. You can pick up the key.
